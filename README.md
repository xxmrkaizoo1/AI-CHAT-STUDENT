## 📌 Project Overview

**Student AI Chatbot** is a web-based application developed to help students ask questions and receive instant answers using **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.

The system is built using the **Laravel framework** and integrates with **real AI technology (OpenAI API)**.  
Unlike normal chatbot systems that use fixed rules or predefined answers, this chatbot uses **real AI models** that can understand questions and generate meaningful responses.

This project is designed specifically for **students**, so the AI is instructed to:
- Use **simple language**
- Explain answers **step by step**
- Avoid complex or confusing explanations
- Focus on learning and understanding
